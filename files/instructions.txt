Survive as long as you can by shooting the enemies! There are two types of enemies: melee enemies 
(red, attack by contact) and ranged enemies (yellow, attack by shooting). Enemies spawn in waves, 
and defeating them increases your score. Enemies in later waves deal more damage but increase your 
score more. Also, defeating a wave before the next one starts earns you bonus points. Good luck!
